### 8. HEALTH OF GAME USERS

PLAION advises you to take the following precautions in all cases when using a video game. Avoid playing if you are tired and/or short of sleep. Make sure that you play in a well lit room and moderate the brightness of your screen. When you play a video game requiring connection to a screen, play at a good distance from the screen and as far away as the connection lead allows. While using the game, take breaks of ten (10) to fifteen (15) minutes every hour.

### 9. EPILEPSY WARNING:

Some individuals are liable to have epileptic fits including, in certain cases, loss of consciousness, particularly when exposed to strong luminous stimulations (rapid succession of images or repetition of simple geometrical figures, flashes or exposures). Such individuals are exposed to risks of fits when they play certain video games containing such luminous stimulations; consult your doctor before any use. Parents must also pay particularly close attention to their children when they play video games. If you or your child present one of the following symptoms: dizziness, vision problems, contraction of the eyes or muscles, disorientation, involuntary movement or convulsions or momentary loss of consciousness, you must immediately stop playing and consult a doctor.

### 10. WARRANTY

Subject to section 13 below, because of its complex nature, software can never be expected to be completely error-free. Therefore, PLAION cannot guarantee that the contents of the Game will meet your expectations, and that the Game will run glitch-free under any possible conditions. Moreover, PLAION assumes no warranty for specific functions and results of this Game in excess of the current minimum standard of software technology at the time the Game was created. The same applies to the accuracy and/or completeness of the accompanying documentation.

Any form of strict liability is excluded in respect of malfunctions in the Game existing at the start of the service provision; i.e. PLAION is only liable insofar as PLAION or its vicarious agents is responsible for this. If the Game should be defective upon delivery so that, despite appropriate handling, it cannot be used for the intended purpose, PLAION will either amend the Game, deliver a new copy, or refund the purchase price within two (2) years of the date of purchase. This applies exclusively to the Game if directly purchased from PLAION.

To claim this warranty, you must send the purchased product, along with your proof of purchase and a description of the error to the following address: Technischer Dienst, c/o PLAION GmbH, Lochhamer Str. 9, D-82152 Planegg, Germany. PLAION assumes no further warranties for any direct or indirect damages resulting from the use of the product, unless these damages were caused through malicious intent or gross negligence, or such a warranty is compulsory by law.

In any case, the amount of the warranty is restricted to the purchase price of the Game. Under no circumstances will PLAION assume warranty for any unforeseeable or non-typical damages. Any claims you may have against the distributor where you purchased the Game are not affected by this.

PLAION assumes no warranty for damages incurred through inappropriate handling, in particular failure to comply with the instruction manual, incorrect initial operation, inappropriate treatment or unsuitable accessories, unless PLAION is responsible for such damages.

### 17. NO ASSIGNMENT

You may not assign or transfer all or some of your rights or obligations under this EULA without PLAION's prior written approval, and any attempt to do so without such consent shall be void.

By using the Game, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list.

### 21. FINAL PROVISIONS

Subject to section 13, this EULA and the policies incorporated herein together with any Game-specific terms or other additional terms you may have agreed upon with PLAION, are the entire agreement between you and PLAION. They supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and PLAION relating to your use of the Services. Your own terms and conditions expressly do not form a part of this EULA. PLAION may assign, subcontract or transfer this EULA, in whole or in part, to a third party or another member of our group if necessary for the support of the Game and/or Services, as part of any reorganization or merger, or for other business reasons provided that this does not negatively affect your rights under this EULA (or alternatively with your consent). Headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation or construction of this EULA. Failure of PLAION to partially or fully exercise any rights or the waiver of PLAION of any breach of this EULA by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by PLAION or be deemed a waiver by PLAION of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any other term of this EULA. The rights and remedies of PLAION under this EULA and any other applicable agreement between you and PLAION shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit PLAION’s right to exercise any other right or remedy.

This EULA does not change your rights under the laws of your jurisdiction if the laws of your jurisdiction do not allow it. In the event that certain provisions of this EULA are held unenforceable by a court, those provisions shall be enforced only to the extent permitted by applicable law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

If a provision of this EULA is or becomes wholly or partially invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions will remain unaffected. This EULA establish and encompass all legal agreements between the parties in relation to the subject matter of their agreement and replaces all former verbal or written agreements, whereby it is assumed that this EULA exists parallel to any applicable terms of use and does not replace them.
